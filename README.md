### Improved Coarse-to-Fine Matching Algorithm

This is the matching algorithm developed in the paper: [Wireless Binocular Stereo Vision Measurement System Based on Improved Coarse-to-fine Matching Algorithm](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/schm/2023/1132569/). The main code can be found in LSTM/LSM_GN_final.cpp
